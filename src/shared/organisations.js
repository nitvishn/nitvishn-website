            Project Neumann is an informal organisation which is an evolution of the Computational Thinking Club. It is a more extensive intercollegiate initiative partly comprised of the same organising members as the club. The members meet multiple times a week to work on projects, discuss and conduct research, and collectively direct our explorations of computer science and mathematics. In the future, we plan to provide a platform for educating high schoolers in college-level computer science concepts and a network of undergraduate researchers with whom they may undertake projects.

        In 10th grade, I received requests from my peers  to send them my notes from an English language seminar. Instead of responding individually, I scraped 150 email addresses from the school directory, set up a GitHub Pages repository with the file on it, created a rudimentary website, and sent it to everybody on a grade-wide email chain.
        This was the first time anyone had begun an intra-grade conversation on this level. Soon, the chain blossomed into activity, and others began to contribute en masse.
        A few months later, my friend Rishi and I then decided to design my own notes sharing repository, Blitz Notes.
        While Rishi worked on the front-end, I built a back-end server and programmed an automatic integration with a notes editor. Together, we designed an easy-to-use workflow for writing and publishing notes. After a monthâ€™s programming and debugging, Blitz Notes, upon release in February 2020, quickly evolved into a massive undertaking. We assigned subject leads and assembled a team of over 30 people in creating up-to-date notes. We are a well-known IB/IGCSE resource. As of July 3rd 2021, we had <strong>143,093 pageviews</strong> from <strong>39,928 regular users</strong> across <strong>148 countries</strong>. We have over <strong>350 webpages</strong> of notes within the site.

I led the team in teaching programming and algorithms to 30+ members from grades 7-12. We also ran an online, open-source data science course, teaching skills in data visualization and analysis using programming to IB and IGCSE students. All the material for the course is available on BlitzNotes in the attached link.
