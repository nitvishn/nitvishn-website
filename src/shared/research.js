        description: `
        This summer, I had the privilege of working with Prof. Tim Chartier as part of the Pioneer Research Program in the mathematics of ranking. After a 10-week program learning ranking methods, I produced a highly theoretical research paper on a Monte-Carlo analysis of competitive balance and reliability across tournament structures.
        The paper has impacted Prof Chartier's independently conducted work and opens up several additional questions regarding ranking and tournament structures.

        abstract: `This paper investigates the effect of increasing competitive balance on the reliability of tournament rankings. Reliability of rankings, a previously qualitative
        property, is quantified in this paper by the closeness between ground truth
        rankings and the rankings of teams at the end of a tournament. Three metrics are used to measure this closeness: Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient,
        Kendall’s tau, and a relatively unused algorithm in the field of ranking: Levenshtein distance. Three tournament structures are simulated: round-robin,
        random pairings, and the Swiss system. The tournaments are simulated across
        multiple trials and over a varying number of games. It is found that the rate
        of growth of reliability of a tournament structure falls as the number of games
        increases. It is also found that there is a positive relationship between competitive imbalance and reliability. The marginal benefit of increasing competitive
        imbalance falls as it is increased. Unexpectedly, in comparison to random pairings and Swiss pairings, the round-robin tournament structure is seen to achieve
        the highest reliability score across all metrics and number of games played. The
        difference in reliability between the tournament structures increases as competitive imbalance is increased. The further work suggested includes investigation
        of tournament outcome uncertainty in conjunction with reliability and competitive balance, a closer study into Levenshtein distance as a useful algorithm to
        quantify closeness between two rankings, and an inquiry into the specific factors
        that bottleneck reliability while the number of games played in a tournament
        increases`,
